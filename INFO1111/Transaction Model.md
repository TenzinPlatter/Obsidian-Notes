The transaction model differs to the [[Claude Shannon]] and 
[[Interaction]] model in that there is one sender and multiple
receivers. The receivers send feedback to the sender. This could
represent something such as a lecture with participation, or a
[[Scrum#scrum-master]] talking to
the [[Scrum#Scrum (development) team]]
