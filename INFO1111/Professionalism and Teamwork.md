# [[Teamwork]]


# Running a successful software project/ business
## Restaurant Analogy
## “Computer Science is no more about coding than running a restaurant is about ingredients”
### In order to run a successful restaurant, one must understand all parts of and be attentive to all components that make it successful.
#### Good quality ingredients
    - Good coding languages/ frameworks
    - High quality tools such as git and Jira
    - Using the correct operating system
        - Linux for systems, microsoft for .NET apps and MacOS for Swift development
#### Good employees
    - Hiring experienced/ skilled engineers
#### What things can you use that have already been made?
    - Frameworks and languages 
        - Creating a language from scratch for a project is unrealistic
        - For something like Webdev, there is no point using raw Javascript, Css and Html when so many front end libraries exist
    - Tools
        - No point reinventing version control when something as good as git exists
#### What tools should you use
    - Use high quality tools
    - Use the correct tools for the job
        - Python is not good for 3d graphics and C is not good for data science/ Webdev
#### Need more than just technical skills
    - This is still a business, so you need things that are integral to all businesses
