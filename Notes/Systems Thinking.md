Broad Level: The connection between solutions, systems that implement them and the society they 
operate within

More Focussed: Components of a system, their interactions and interrelationships can be analyzed
individually to see how they influence the functioning of the whole system. 

This is important as you cannot program an entire system, you must break it down and code each
individual part

Systems are complex and dynamic
    - Feedback loops
    - Causality (not always clear)
    - Emergent behavior (e.g. adapting products for tasks that designers never intended - safety
      concerns)
    - Behavior over time can vary
    - Can be unpredictable


Due to these factors, systems thinking has a lot of unexpected consequences, e.g. the Therac-25,
which killed 6 people due to a race condition that was missed in the original testing of the product
