P: 
- Problems that can be solved in polynomial time (e.g. not exponential)

NP:
- Problems that if given an answer, the answer can be verified in polynomial time, but there is no
  way to find an answer

P = NP means that if a problem could be verified in polynomial time, it can also be solved in
polynomial time.
It is widely believed that P does not equal NP
