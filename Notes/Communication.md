# Communication

## Transmission models
- [[Claude Shannon]]
- [[Interaction Model]]
- [[Transaction Model]]

## Things to consider for effective communication
- Has the information been received as intended
- Is the sender or receiver responsible for effective communication, and how can it be ensured
- What is your goal (what do you want to change in your audience after your communication?)
- Know your audience
    - What do they already know
    - Where do they come from
    - What do they expect
    - What do they value
- Explain things in relationship to what is already known


## Communication in IT
1. Client specifies project needs to Company Head
2. Company head specifies needs to developers and testers
3. Developers write code
4. Testers test code given original needs
5. Code is pushed to production
