Model consists of 5 elements:

1. Information source
    - Produces the message
2. A Transmitter
    - Encodes the message 
3. A Channel
    - Signals are adapted to this channel to be transmitted
4. A Receiver 
    - Decodes (reconstructs the message)
5. A Destination
    - Where the message arrives

There is a 6$^{th}$ element noise, which is a dysfunctional factor, and represents any interference along the channel
