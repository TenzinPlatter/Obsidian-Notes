# Scrum

In Scrum, the full projects requirements don't need to be planned out at the start, only what is needed for the next sprint.

Scrum is often deployed in conjunction with other agile methods
such as [[Extreme Programming]]

## The Scrum Process:

### Sprints
Each sprint is a set period of team where the team completes a set amount of work. At the end of each sprint, the product should be fully functional and able to be shipped.

### Scrum Roles

#### Scrum Master
Not involved with decision-making, but make sure the team follows the scrum process

#### Product Owner
Manages the backlog of work and product releases 

#### Scrum (development) team
A team of usually 5 to 9 people, consisting of roles such as [[Teamwork#types-of-teamwork-for-it-professionals]]
